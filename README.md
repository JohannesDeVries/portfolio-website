# Portfolio website

I developed this website to showcase the personal projects Iâ€™ve worked on. I build the site from scratch using HTML and CSS to demonstrate my raw skill with the languages, especially CSS.

## Advanced CSS concepts:
- Flexbox layout - I used it in all the sections on my web page.
- Grid layout - I used grid to display the different projects in the portfolio section.
- Media queries -The website is fully responsive and mobile friendly
- Transitions - The buttons, headings and images have transition effects.
- Absolute/Relative positioning - I used it on the button on the project images to center them in the middle of the image and the unordered list in the contact_container class.

## External Resources:
- Google Fonts
- Font Awesome

I used Netlify to deploy the website.
